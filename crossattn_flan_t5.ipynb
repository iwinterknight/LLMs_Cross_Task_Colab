the boneless bite of chicken wing. once you remove the 2 bones, you are left with a boneless chunk of meat. take 1-2 bites to eat your boneless wing. hold the chicken wing in both of your hands. before you take a bite, grip your chicken wing with your index finger and thumb. this way, you can easily tear into it and get the meat. do this for either the drumette or wingette.\n","QUESTION : how do i properly eat chicken in a professional setting?\n","GENERATED RESPONSE : if you are eating chicken in a restaurant, do not eat it with your fork.\n","\n","\n","PASSAGE : drain the water from the potatoes, then add the butter to the pot. carefully drain the potatoes into a colander. transfer the potatoes back into the hot pot, and then add 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of butter. mix the potatoes and butter together until the butter has completely melted. ghee is a great substitute for butter if you cant have dairy products. add the 3 cup (160 ml) of milk and mash the potatoes. pour the milk into the pot and start stirring and mashing everything together. use a manual potato masher, or you could also use a ricer to get a really smooth consistency. avoid adding in any additional liquids to the potatoes. they need to be creamy yet firm for this recipe so they dont melt down into the meat mixture.\n","QUESTION : can i start with potatoes then add mince and cheese on top?\n","GENERATED RESPONSE : yes, you can. if you do not like the texture of the potatoes, then you can add mince and cheese on top.\n","\n","\n","PASSAGE : stir in the turmeric, chili powder, coriander, and masala. add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon (2.55 g) of chili powder, 1 teaspoon (2.5 g) of ground coriander, and 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) of garam masala. stir and heat the spices for 1 minute. you can taste the sauce at this point and add a little salt according to your taste.\n","QUESTION : can turmeric be frozen?\n","GENERATED RESPONSE : turmeric can be stored in the freezer, where it usually can last 8 to 12 months. however, turmeric is best when stored in the fridge, where it usually can last 1 to 2 weeks.\n","\n","\n","PASSAGE : act quickly. this is the most important step for proper stain removal. the faster you begin cleanup, the better your results will be. stains left alone for a long time begin to set, becoming harder to remove. if a stain has dried and set in a valuable or irreplaceable item, restoration is still possible! however, the methods are fairly complicated and possibly dangerous to the inexperienced. if the methods outlined here are not enough, consult a professional archivist. assess the damage. is your item salvageable? stain removal is typically reserved for relatively small areas of discoloration. you can clean a splash of tea, but nothing can be realistically done for a paperback soaked by a whole pot.\n","QUESTION : how can i get rid of coca cola stains in a book?\n","GENERATED RESPONSE : soak the book in hot water for a few minutes, then wipe it clean with a damp cloth.\n","\n","\n","PASSAGE : find furniture with built-in storage space to keep clutter hidden. look for seating options that have hidden drawers where you store blankets or linens. that way, you can hide any clutter while still easily accessing it. find multipurpose furniture, like a bed where the headboard is a bookshelf or an ottoman that opens up. consider getting furniture that you can fold up or push against the wall, like a futon or murphy bed.tip: get a loft or bunk bed for your bedroom so you can have extra storage space or even a small work desk underneath.\n","QUESTION : what is the meaning of ottoman?\n","GENERATED RESPONSE : as an adjective, ottomang is usually defined as: of or relating to the ottoman empire. as a noun, ottomang is usually defined as: of or relating to the ottoman empire. for more, ask me to give you more definitions for ottomang.\n","\n","\n","PASSAGE : mix the dry ingredients together. mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt. you can add spices to taste as well.\n","QUESTION : what is the origin of baking powder?\n","GENERATED RESPONSE : baking powder is from united states.\n","\n","\n","PASSAGE : use the 3-digit code that tells you when the eggs were packaged. sell-by or best-by dates are not required by federal law (some states require them, other states forbid them), but all eggs must be labeled with the date they were packaged. this date usually appears as a 3 digit code using the julian date calendar. this means eggs packaged on january 1st would be labeled 001, eggs packaged on october 15th would be labeled 288, december 31st 365. look for the julian date on the end of the carton. you will see the plant code (a letter p followed by numbers) indicated where the eggs were packaged, and beside it you should find the julian code. the european union also requires that eggs are marked with a pack date. even if eggs are sold loose and not in a marked carton, the consumer should have access to that information. throw out any eggs that have been refrigerated and then sat out at room temperature for two hours or more. once an egg has cooled in your refrigerator, it is important to keep it at the same temperature. a cool egg in a warmer environment begins to sweat, which can encourage bacteria to grow on the outside of the egg. because the egg shell is porous, it is sometimes possible for the bacteria on the shell to pass into through and contaminate the egg. to prevent temperature fluctuations, store your eggs in the coldest part of your refrigerator, not on the door. the temperature is more likely to fluctuate on the door when it is opening and closing, which may cause your eggs to sweat. if you receive your eggs unwashed and at room temperature, they do not need to be refrigerated. many countries, including most european countries, keep their eggs at room temperature. this is safe because eggs are laid with a protective bloom which naturally keeps bacteria out. once the eggs are washed, however, they must be refrigerated. also, in most european countries, the hens have been inoculated against salmonella prior to laying their eggs.\n","QUESTION : is it true that eggs that have never been refrigerated do not actually need to be?\n","GENERATED RESPONSE : no, they need to be refrigerated if you want them to be safe.\n","\n","\n","PASSAGE : prune your plants in the spring before they hit the growth period. from april to may, your dracaena plant comes out of rest mode and gets ready to go into the blooming season. pruning your plants before they hit the growth period keeps them healthy. this also makes it easier to shape the plants into your ideal look. while you can prune your dracaena whenever you would like, this helps encourage new, healthy growth.\n","QUESTION : if my dracaena plant got too cold and the leaves turned brown, can it be saved?\n","GENERATED RESPONSE : yes, it can be salvaged.\n","\n","\n","PASSAGE : load your washer with clothes. this is pretty simple  just dump your clothes in, but be careful not to overcrowd your clothes. you need space for your garments to move and clean themselves. some machines may even have options to indicate whether your load is small, medium, or heavy. this option adjusts the water levels within your wash cycle according to the size of the load. small loads fill about a third (1/3) of your machine. medium loads fill half (1/2) of your machine. large loads fill three fourths (3/4) of your machine. turn on your washer. ah,

opinion is no reason to call him/her a moron or an idiot. set aside a certain amount of time the group can spend on politics. if this group loves to dive into politics but you really dont want it to take over the entire party, lightly announce (with a smile) that the group should only focus on politics for the next 10 minutes and then you are hijacking the conversation to talk about something else. turn politics into a funny game. for example, if you know the conversation could go south insist that every guest end his or her serious political statement with in bed or something ridiculous to keep the mood light. have a moderator from each side keep emotions in check. pull a few folks aside who seem to have their head on their shoulders and can act as a peacemaker or can steer the conversation away from an ugly situation. if possible find two people who have opposing political opinions so each can talk to their own people if necessary. if you believe this group cant keep

log cabin type meal relished by the earlier presidents like adams or lincoln. for dessert, you could serve a few fun jellybeans as a nod to reagan along with cherries jubilee to honor washington. recreate an inaugural meal. no matter which side of the aisle you sit, any political junkie will scarf up the recreation of an inaugural meal. pick and choose from different past presidents first meals--you could even create an inaugural mash-up and include what several presidents ate. set your table as if its the white house. you could even peruse former first lady china patterns and settings

when watering should be resumed. watch out for bud drop. one of the most frustrating things that can happen to christmas cactus is after the flower buds have developed they drop off the plant. bud drop can be caused by several different conditions. usually it is because of over-watering, but it can also be due to a lack of humidity or insufficient light. if this starts happening, water the plant less and add some fertilizer to the pot. move it to an area away from a hot radiator or vent and try a new spot where it can get a bit more sunlight.\n","QUESTION : why are the leaves on my
